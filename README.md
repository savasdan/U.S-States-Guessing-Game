# U.S. States Guessing Game

This is a simple Python game where you try to guess all 50 U.S. states.

The program shows a blank map of the United States and asks you to enter state names.  
When you guess a state correctly, its name is written on the map in the correct position.  
If you type `Exit`, the game ends and a CSV file is created with the states you didn't guess.
